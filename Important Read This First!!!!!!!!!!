1 post in the chat on teams that you are going to edit code or ad code

2 we will be using micro python so start your files with import machine

3 once you're done editing the code send a chat in teams saying that I am done in my code to be tested

4 wait for my response and wait 5 to 10 minutes before editing your code again

5 You will see changes to your code when I am done with it

6 have fun be nice! And keep me updated on changes;)
